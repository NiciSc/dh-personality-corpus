She loves architecture and spends her free time designing new buildings or visiting national monuments. She has a soft side for those who seek knowledge. She sometimes gets too philosophical, which makes the less complicated Percy to glaze his eyes. \n(https://riordan.fandom.com/wiki/Annabeth_Chase)", "follow_count": 8, "id": 4777, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Annabeth Chase", "post_count": 15, "source_profile_id": 5155, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/ce888c74ae034f14913272cc27101b61.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "#ENTPHeroes", "follow_count": 7, "id": 10206, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Leo Valdez", "post_count": 9, "source_profile_id": 10910, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/f5f8ec3773204a0db56e4e29b6749219.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "#ISTJHeroes", "follow_count": 1, "id": 11148, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Reyna Ram\u00edrez-Arellano", "post_count": 5, "source_profile_id": 12046, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/38fe202eb96b4aa28aa7f32b9f1147e8.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "#ENFJVillains", "follow_count": 0, "id": 11143, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Luke Castellan", "post_count": 5, "source_profile_id": 12041, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/8d51412f2ff9468fbf43e7ed1d446ca6.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "Jason Grace was a Roman demigod, the son of Jupiter and the mortal Beryl Grace and the younger brother of Thalia Grace.

Like how is she a ni dom? Her si>te , also how does she have inferior se? Seems like an ESTJ or an ENTJ ( from the lightning thief to the last olympian only)\n\nWhat I'm saying . . . I hate it when people let me down, when things are temporary. I think that's why I want to be an architect.\"\n\nPercy, for so much of my life, I felt like everything was changing, all the time. I didn't have anyone I could rely on.\"\n\nThese are the quotes told by Annabeth chase and after reading these how is she still typed as an INTJ?\n\nNow im reading the hoo series and the demigods and magicians and i see a lot of si than te - most of the time she battles monsters and strategizes using pure facts...nothing indicates that she is interested in abstract theories . She predicts things based on facts i'm kinda confused whether she has si or ni - either she is a very creative - out of the box thinker ISTJ or an INTJ with a very good memory but I'm leaning more towards si. Her thirst for knowledge and facts is obvious but her plans seem mostly based on si rather than ni. She literally tells sadie that she prefers a framework of knowledge and facts/data of anything before going into battle . She is taken aback by the concept of the duat and upset by the new concept (inferior ne) . A lot of times she seems use her past experiences when strategizing or evaluating things . She prides herself on her experiences and even refers herself as a seasoned veteran\n\n\n\nI also care about what lasts. I want to find out what\u2019s permanent in life so I can build on it. For something to qualify, it must endure and prove itself correct and reliable.\n\ud83d\udc46 this is something a si dom and annabeth chase would say she craves stability and is unnerved or disturbed by unexpected changes . I think she is mistyped as a ni dom because she just knows things but most of her \"intuitive leaps\" are based on her past experiences . She's just very confident in her si which makes it look like ni. In the staff of serapis she is hesitant to destroy the staff because she fears the consequences of destroying her future. Si doms in a situation depend on their facts to deal with something , if they don't have any info with they focus on the sensory details around them and come up with extra information and act on it. The whole time annabeth acts on sensory details when she has no experience in the matter. Like in the mark of athena she overcomes most of her challenges by gathering information by keenly observing the details around her . The only argument i heard for her ni is that she Plans but Annabeth is an si user with a photographic memory . Strong si users can also predict the future which often is misunderstood as ni. And another argument for her being ni is that she wants to become an architect ( not only INTJs want to become architects), she has a futuristic ambition or a vision to the future ( which again is a stereotype , a lot of sensors are ambitious) . She never disdain towards the physical world .\n\n\"Wish I knew what we were dealing with,\u2019 she muttered as they crept towards the building. \u2018I like to do research first \u2013 arm myself with knowledge\"\n\n\n\"But this two-headed crab thing \u2013 she had no frame of reference for it. Her internal compass was spinning uselessly.\"\n\nSi doms love to surround themselves in places which mean to them or give them a good feeling\n[Eg:There were other ways to get back to her high school dorm from the Upper East Side, but Annabeth liked going through Grand Central Terminal. The beautiful design and the vast open space reminded her of Mount Olympus. Grandbuildings made her feel better\u2014maybe because being in a place so permanent made her feel more permanent. ]\nShe feels anxious when she and percy lose their grey streaks as if they lost a symbolic bond. She loves being near the sea because it reminds her of percy and she takes him to the stables because it reminds her of great moment she shares with percy. She's actually very detail oriented .\n\nI also noticed that most of ricks characters are somewhere mixed between ni and si . As rick is a ne dom and inf si i think he misinterprets si doms as ni doms .
