Despite his initial claims of skepticism to the supernatural, he is later revealed to be deeply connected with the paranormal and about the town's weird paranormal status, most notably the decades-long operation of an interdimensional portal he used to rescue his twin brother, Stanford. He is the tritagonist of the series. Stan is represented on the Zodiac wheel as the crescent symbol present on his fez.\n\n#AlexHirsch\n#ESTPHeroes", "follow_count": 0, "id": 1042, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Stanley Pines \u201cGrunkle Stan\u201d", "post_count": 9, "source_profile_id": 1106, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/2710cccb620842779fc54d2d7ceb4a9e.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "#ENFJVillains #YandereCharacters", "follow_count": 0, "id": 34862, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Giffany", "post_count": 9, "source_profile_id": 39007, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/430267cae4f1467494d83da09e03f614.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "Stanford \u201cFord\u201d Filbrick Pines (born June 15, 1954, 15 minutes before his twin brother, Stanley Pines), also known as The Author, or simply Grunkle Ford, is a paranormal investigator who came to Gravity Falls, Oregon, to study the huge concentration of supernatural activity in and around the town. After spending years cataloging his research in a series of journals, he disappeared into an alternate dimension. His writings were left as the only evidence of his existence. Ford's identity and whereabouts were a central mystery and element of foreshadowing of the Gravity Falls series until the middle of the show's second season when he was revealed to be Stan's long-lost twin brother, who vanished after a fight with his brother caused him to stumble through the universe portal.

Traveling the country, making different passports, driving recklessly, fights the zombies, & doesn\u2019t care about feelings but about results n facts when speaking to his employees n family.\n\nTi: Inventive, independent thinker, picks up on news information easily, & insensitive to emotional opinions.  His scams, doesn\u2019t want the normal life his parents had, easily sees new ways to manipulate people (Ti & Fe).  Literally uses gum to slow dice down & make it stick on a certain number to win the board game (also comes up with that on the fly) screams (Ti & Se combo).\n\nFe: Charming, manipulative, observant of others feelings, & values groups.  Stan easily uses his charm to convince people to buy into **** that\u2019s obviously fake.  Easily picks up on the emotions others hide then exposes them (does this to dipper all the time & once to Robbie).  He also has a high appreciation n respect for his family no matter how distant he is with them.  Literally works 5-10 years to bring his brother back, doesn\u2019t hold any anger towards his father for kicking him out, & willingly takes in his niece m nephew without knowing them because their his family.  He\u2019s in a constant search for the people he values to appreciate him for himself the whole reason he made his goal to \u201cget rich\u201d was to show his family he wasn\u2019t a loser when he was kicked out (Fe & Ni).  \n\nNi: Stan doesn\u2019t look into the future much & doesn\u2019t value it.  He sees his brothers big thinking subjects as \u201cnerdy\u201d & whenever dipper has a crazy idea about something he doesn\u2019t seem to put much value in it.  Stan is physical, tough, & grounded person more than his head is in the clouds.  But once he does put his mind to something it\u2019s hard to get him off it which that tunnel vision can be associated with unhealthy Ni.  Brining his brother back & getting rich.\n\n8w7: Tough, blunt, bull headed, prideful, tenacious, reckless, & quick.  All words to describe Stan pines very well & all words that connect to 8s especially 8w7s.  Stan before he was kicked out by his parents motivation revolved around traveling the world looking for gold n riches.  Which is yearning for independence, adventure, & freedom.  8s with the 7 wing will want control, direction, & have a hard time listening to authority figures (like Stan does when he was in school).  But 8w7s will be much louder, bolder, & looking to expand their often restlessness they want everything life has to offer them n are willing to push through any obstacle to achieve it.  Stan has always been a independent & wouldn\u2019t let anybody dictate the direction of his life but himself.
