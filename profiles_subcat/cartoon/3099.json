Bo's personality in the strip and in the Garfield and Friends cartoons are vastly different from each other.

Troubles never ruined his day due to him being too scatterbrained to notice. In Garfield and Friends, he was portrayed as a surfer-dude, used slang in just about all his sentences, was particularly bright and always cool, collected, and dependable. He retains some of his dimness in a few episodes (such as cooking spaghetti one noodle at a time or microwaving a single pea). He often disagrees with his sister Lanolin, since she is always mean to him and sometimes finds it difficult to get along with her.
