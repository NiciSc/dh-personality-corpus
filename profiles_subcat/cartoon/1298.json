He has worked as a pornographic film director, as a US Soldier, and as a Police Officer. He is quite pretentious and is a self-absorbed narcissist. He is egotistical and severely egomaniacal (this may be because of his bad behavior, which he continuously blames on somebody else rather than himself). He treats his fellow family members poorly and commits various crimes. He and Stewie are the most intelligent of all of the members of the Griffin family. However, because of his ego and sometimes being as reckless as Peter, Brian is less intelligent than he makes himself at to be.

Also, various story lines give him autistic savant talents, such as artistic ability, and detailed knowledge of film and TV actors. Both he and Peter have also demonstrated proficiency in the use of American Sign Language. Occasionally he exhibits unexpected, uncharacteristic insights, such as when he gives Peter and Lois a detailed and articulate lecture on the effects and disadvantages of marijuana. He has also demonstrated an ability to quickly adapt to new cultural surroundings. For example, when the family moved to London, England, Chris was the only member of the family who was able to quickly learn and speak cockney English.\n#SethGreen", "follow_count": 0, "id": 1218, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Chris Griffin", "post_count": 1, "source_profile_id": 1297, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/d6f8b41b30ff4d8ab7e4c76273380acc.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "Peter displays a radical shift in personality near the beginning of Season 4, as his character flaws which were previously counterbalanced by virtues now completely overshadow them.", "follow_count": 0, "id": 339901, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Peter Griffin (Seasons 1-3)", "post_count": 1, "source_profile_id": 499619, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/a6d48b8909f24ee9a75d3441da10d7ae.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "\u2026", "follow_count": 1, "id": 340285, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Meg Griffin (early seasons)", "post_count": 1, "source_profile_id": 507252, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/d2c2db40e3dc4a8594149ad875c83e2d.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "\nFull name\nLois Patrice Griffin\nLast Reported Age\n43\nEpisodes\nAppears only in archive footage during the musical numbers in \"Brian & Stewie\".
