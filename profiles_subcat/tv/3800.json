But much of this evidence is from seasons 1,2 and 3, so bare with me. We know from season one, from the scene where he's studying with nancy, that he doesn't do well with focusing. Even though you can argue that he was there to get with Nancy, he couldn't even focus on the flashcards. Moving on to his college essay in season two, he makes loads of careless mistakes that Nancy calls out. Steve isn't much of a student. Now, academics aside, his behavior is the true teller of whether or not he has ADHD. In season one, you can tell that his strong sense of justice stops him from further engaging in the movie theatre incident, where he drops Carol and Tommy as his friends because what they did was wrong. I'd also like to argue that the fight between him and nancy, where she calls their relationship \"********,\" might've caused his rejection sensitivity instead of understanding that nancy was drunk; and eventually caused their breakup. But the one thing Steve is is impulsive. Steve constantly gets into fights he never wins; he does things without thinking, like bringing Lucas's 11-year-old sister down with him, robin, and Dustin to the Russian lab. he admits his love for nancy impulsively without realizing she's already taken. He constantly puts himself first in dangerous situations, unaware if he lives or dies. I'm scared this impulsivity might get him killed in season 5. he doesn't focus on things he needs to focus on, like his future, especially when he was working at scoops ahoy and entertaining robin's tactics. She even calls him out, saying, \"I didn't know you could read\" (something along the lines of that), which is a call back to how poorly he did academically while in school, where he made careless mistakes.
