Son of Mine was the last to be punished, a prisoner of his own conscious mind with a burlap sack draped over his face.\n\nNoticeably, he spoke in a way that made many of his consecutive sentences run together. After possessing Baines, Son of Mine appeared able to keep his eyes opened all the way most of the time. Perhaps as a side-effect from possessing Baines, the right side of Son of Mine's face was nearly always in a half-smile.\n\nHe was probably the most intelligent of his Family, which would explain why he took charge of the Family.\n#INTJVillains", "follow_count": 0, "id": 65818, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Son of Mine", "post_count": 1, "source_profile_id": 81180, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/25d2c7e968574a19873b615f161f7ef2.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "#ENFPVillains", "follow_count": 0, "id": 65805, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "O / The Master", "post_count": 1, "source_profile_id": 81166, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/2c46a8a34d314dbbb2c2265c28f8f684.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "", "follow_count": 0, "id": 9115, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Danny Pink", "post_count": 1, "source_profile_id": 9743, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/48b7f0dd20f245dfaaa59d811ccc423c.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "", "follow_count": 0, "id": 165030, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Face of Boe", "post_count": 1, "source_profile_id": 213813, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/75b3c5b7e1ec4e7f9f91ed6153bb5f0a.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "#MaisieWilliams as Ashildr", "follow_count": 0, "id": 31982, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Ashildr/Me", "post_count": 1, "source_profile_id": 35720, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/dbb75cb14eba47708176e37ab7acd38c.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "", "follow_count": 0, "id": 345030, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "The Fourteenth Doctor", "post_count": 1, "source_profile_id": 584283, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/fb0212829b38428c8217ecad4b522a10.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "The twelfth (technically the thirteenth) incarnation of The Doctor. The Twelfth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Scottish actor #PeterCapaldi.

Stern and ruthless, but also kind and forgiving, the Twelfth Doctor was the first incarnation of the Doctor's second regeneration cycle, bestowed upon him by the Time Lords at Clara Oswald's urging at the end of the Siege of Trenzalore.\n\nAssured of the survival of Gallifrey, the Doctor was no longer chained down by guilt, becoming a less amiable character, as he no longer needed to cover the pain of what he thought was the extinction of the Time Lords, with a withdrawn attitude who habitually questioned his own goodness.
