There\u2019s so many possible reasons for the weird ways he\u2019s acted throughout the seasons. I beg y\u2019all to go on tumblr and look at the analysis\u2019s of Mike Wheeler and his internalized homophobia, it actually makes alotta sense like why he acted so weird at the airport and stuff.\n\nAs much as I hate him, I\u2019m still gonna defend him lol. He\u2019s one of the most loyal characters. He obviously cares ALOT about Will and El, but look here\u2019s the thing. This boy is gay. Idc if you say he\u2019s not, cuz he is. Him and El are going to break up.\n\nAnd also, this boy has been thru alotta trauma too and it\u2019s been hinted that he\u2019s depressed and remember in season 1 when he stepped off the cliff? Yeah \ud83d\ude2c\n\nSo pretty sure he was a crush on Will that he hasn\u2019t come to terms with, or he\u2019s hiding it and repressing is and pushing it away, hence his weird behavior like at the airport and there is SO MUCH MORE I could go more into detail about but I\u2019ll cut it here.
