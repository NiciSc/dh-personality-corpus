When she\u2019s upset, her immediate desire is the comfort of company instead of wanting to be alone. Her sense of power and control is exerted through her demands for admiration and attention- which also hides her inner fear and insecurities. All of this points to her being an Extravert- this near-dependence on others to gain the energy and fulfillment. (This isn\u2019t to say she isn\u2019t independent- she\u2019s very independent. My point here is that she prefers to receive her sense of strength and energy from others- her immediate reflex desire is directed towards others.)\n\nN\n\nThis one stems quite a lot of debate. But my reason in typing Blair as having Ni is because of her focus on deeper meanings. Look at Nate and the pin/charm- she\u2019s always attempting to create symbols, motifs, and plot devices to define the things around her. Also note her fascination with art and museums- she was able to stare at that painting in Paris for days, analyzing the meanings and story behind its physics beauty. Her information-intake preference is reliant on meanings rather than the objective, realistic detail in things.\n\nSome place value in her reminiscent style of Audrey Hepburn, and the real life dreams she has based on them. Although certain fans interpret this as \u201cremembering\u201d and \u201cliving in the present\u201d, it may also be interpreted as her attempt to relate her struggles to someone she desires to be, or at least be like. This highlights her attempt to connect subtler insinuations in meanings- dreaming herself into a situation of her role model highlights her more Turbulent nature in convincing herself that her struggles and failures happen to who she considers \u201cthe best\u201d and \u201cthe ideal\u201d.\n\nThis can be further implicated through her quote on fashion. She calls it \u201cthe most powerful art form there is\u201d, claiming something along the lines of how it defines who you are or who you want to be. Unlike an S, she doesn\u2019t dress purely based one and according to aesthetics- she uses her style as a form, an outlet, to build her identity and personal definition through the meanings behind each choice and placement of clothing.\n\nIt may also be notable the way she often speaks in metaphors, or relate things figuratively. These metaphors and symbolic relations often have quite a mark of originality and creativity to them. This is one of the key marks of an N.\n\nShe is also future-focused: her decisions rely on her desires for what may come, rather than a present, here-and-now reaction, although this will be expanded on in the J section.\n\nT\n\nBlair is able to make decisions objectively. Although occasionally and uncharacteristically choosing emotional decisions over logical ones, we can see that 1) the emotional decisions have logical backup, and 2) the emotional decisions were mostly made in the circumstances of Chuck, whom we know very well is part of one of Blair\u2019s more \u201cunorthodox\u201d or \u201cuncharacteristic\u201d life choices; he is more of a special case in her life than someone in line with her personality.\n\nA perhaps less relevant point is that Blair is able to voice her cruel thoughts and express them outright to people, free of sugarcoating, remorse, or consideration. The reason I state this is \u201ca perhaps less relevant point\u201d is because of two points which may counter this claim: 1) This may merely be a result of Blair\u2019s lack of consideration for other people- her narcissism- or 2) She is cruel to people because she feels that she would prefer such a response in a given situation- she may believe such a response would make her feel better. (This second counter can however be interpreted as supporting evidence rather than counter evidence for Blair being a T)\n\nHer Te is also shown through her ability to \u201ccommand\u201d others and have a situation under control. In many ways, Blair embodies the Te function with her persevering and tenacious output at a given goal. She is willing to do nearly anything to fulfill a goal.\n\nJ\n\nThis one is also rather given. Blair\u2019s personality involves her obsession with planning and controlling everything (linking to her Te). When attempting to \u201ckill her real self\u201d, she says she \u201ccan\u2019t plan everything, control everything\u201d (or something along those lines). Planning is a key factor of the Judging trait.\n\nOverall this makes her an ENTJ, which sums her personality up rather holistically and without much to refute over. Given theories and models aren\u2019t perfect, she can be (and has been) interpreted as many different types, as the propensities which stem from each letter trait can be explained from multiple perspectives.", "create_date": 1673847287000, "unix_timestamp": 1673847287000, "update_date": 1673847287000, "vote_count": 2, "vote_count_down": 0, "is_reported": 0, "is_hidden": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_watching": false, "is_pro_user": false, "images": null, "audios": null, "function_list": [], "type": "post"}, {"username": "nqtsb", "user_pic_path": "https://static1.personality-database.com/user_avatars/1886796/6f667493-e174-4bab-ac5d-ff8a4995e856_small.jpeg", "user_personality_type": "ENTJ-3w4", "is_mod": false, "comment_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "vote_type": 0, "topics_list": [{"id": 1784, "name_readable": "Blair Waldorf"}], "id": 2197194, "post_id": 2197194, "user_id": 1886796, "title": "Why Blair Waldorf is an ESTJ:", "content": "Blair responds to everything that happens to her proactively, by finding some way to fix or improve the situation through practical means.
