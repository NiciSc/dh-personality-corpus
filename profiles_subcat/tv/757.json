Although still lovably dorky, he is less goofy and affable compared to the Eleventh Doctor and values a pragmatic approach. Twelve exploits the full breadth of his age and experience as a Time Lord rather than hiding from it, and can be dangerous and difficult as a result. Because he is a bit blunt and insensitive at times, he occasionally outdoes his predecessor's alien mannerisms. Unlike some past incarnations, he hates being touched and has little interest in flirting with anyone; even a simple hug makes him squeamish at first. Despite all of this, he remains capable of incredible compassion towards even the least likely souls, still determined to be the man who saves people - Earth, as he often warns enemies, is definitely under his protection and, if you hurt it (or things he cares about), he's coming for you. And God help you when he does.
