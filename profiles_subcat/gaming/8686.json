However, he was captured by G.U.N. and put into stasis. After being reawoken and finding his own purpose in the world, he has become a somewhat brooding anti-hero and a persistent rival to Sonic. Shadow is a very straightforward individual; he's aloof, taciturn, and ambitious. Because of his attitude, he is extremely hard to get along with and has a very independent nature, preferring to work on his own more often than not. While he's often ruthless and extremely pragmatic, he can show both empathy and compassion when the situation calls for it. He prefers a straightforward, rather blunt approach to problems, and tends to handle situations in a fist-to-face, foot-to-groin, head-to-knee kind of way, regardless if he feels like it or not, and most of of the time he does feel like it.", "watch_count": 1444, "comment_count": 505, "vote_count": 593, "vote_count_enneagram": 360, "vote_count_mbti": 593, "total_vote_counts": 1449,
