He is a member of the street music group Vivid BAD SQUAD.\n\nWhen Akito was in elementary school, he played for an unnamed soccer team. He was notably very good at soccer but he decided to quit after he and his team lost an important tournament. Some time after he quit playing soccer, he was dragged by his older sister, Ena (who was in middle school at the time), to a summer festival.\n\nAfter viewing a concert at the festival, Ena suggested that he should try out singing, and gave him a small speech, saying that he shouldn't give up on things without even bothering to try them. This kickstarted his interest in street music, which eventually grew into the dream of surpassing the legendary music event RAD WEEKEND.\n\n He now looks up to Shiraishi Ken, An's father who performed in RAD WEEKEND, and practices hard to achieve his dream.", "watch_count": 908, "comment_count": 350, "vote_count": 617, "vote_count_enneagram": 386, "vote_count_mbti": 617, "total_vote_counts": 1832, "personality_type": "ENTJ - 3w4 - sp/sx - 461 - ESI - RLOEI - EFVL - Choleric-Melancholic - IF(S)", "type_updated_date": "2022-11-27 08:09:22", "enneagram_vote": "", "enneagram_vote_id": 0, "mbti_vote": "", "mbti_vote_id": 0, "is_watching": false, "image_exists": false, "profile_image_url": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/3e0bacd2c02941e4b51e7b4828d4b46c.png", "profile_image_credit": "", "profile_image_credit_id": 460010, "profile_image_credit_type": "0", "profile_image_credit_url": "lock his profile so people stop changing his photo ", "alt_subcategory": "", "related_subcategories": "", "cat_id": 11, "category": "Gaming", "category_is_fictional": true, "sub_cat_id": 8976, "subcategory": "Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE!", "subcat_link_info": {"sub_cat_id": 8976, "cat_id": 11, "property_id": 2, "subcategory": "Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE!"}, "related_subcat_link_info": null, "related_profiles": [{"id": 128383, "mbti_profile": "Mafuyu Asahina", "subcategory": "Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE!", "profile_image_url": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/9cc5173bf14c455cbdce3c6e132ef4f7.png", "profile_name": "Mafuyu Asahina", "profile_subcat": "Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE!", "sub_cat_id": 8976, "cat_id": 11, "property_id": 2, "mbti": "INFJ", "enneatype": "5w4"}, {"id": 128380, "mbti_profile": "Mizuki Akiyama", "subcategory": "Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE!", "profile_image_url": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/49b90c8a40be4dd586b426eab3e3db00.png", "profile_name": "Mizuki Akiyama", "profile_subcat": "Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE!", "sub_cat_id": 8976, "cat_id": 11, "property_id": 2, "mbti": "ESFP", "enneatype": "2w3"}, {"id": 128381, "mbti_profile": "Kanade Yoisaki", "subcategory": "Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE!", "profile_image_url": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/d22adebd50ce4425a0c477390f2e26ba.png", "profile_name": "Kanade Yoisaki", "profile_subcat": "Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE!", "sub_cat_id": 8976, "cat_id": 11, "property_id": 2, "mbti": "INFP", "enneatype": "4w5"}, {"id": 240235, "mbti_profile": "Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE!
