He is a large, powerful, fire-breathing Koopa who leads the Koopa Troop, an antagonistic organization of turtle-like creatures, and has been the archenemy of Mario since his debut in Super Mario Bros. He has repeatedly kidnapped or attempted to kidnap Princess Peach with the ultimate goal of defeating Mario and taking over the Mushroom Kingdom. Bowser's defining traits are his monstrous appearance, full-throated roar, fire-breathing abilities, cruel personality, and his never-ending conflict with Mario and unrequited crush for Peach.\n#KamidereCharacters", "follow_count": 0, "id": 3170, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Bowser", "post_count": 2, "source_profile_id": 3444, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/906917f6fa8f40b384d9c3a03e8150fd.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "", "follow_count": 0, "id": 271722, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Rabbid Luigi", "post_count": 1, "source_profile_id": 353050, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/5512d20386ec4745accbcce786310c32.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "Lakitus are Koopas who ride clouds through the skies, mostly dropping Spiny Eggs on the ground or near the player.
