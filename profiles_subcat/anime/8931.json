High School, where he got in through official recommendations and is training to become a Pro Hero. He is the youngest son of Endeavor, the No. 1 (formerly No. 2) Hero, and one of the main protagonists of the series.  Shoto originally had a cold, aloof personality, which stemmed from his abusive upbringing and complicated family life. Focused and unemotional, Shoto preferred to keep to himself instead of hanging out with other people. After the events of the U.A. Sports Festival, however, Shoto notably became more sociable and kind, even gaining a sense of humor and occasionally smiling, although still retaining some fragments of his previous distant attitude. Shoto is not quite used to socializing yet, coming off as dense when it comes to understanding certain figures of speech.", "watch_count": 4910, "comment_count": 1324, "vote_count": 3107,
