He seems very crystal clear SO4 to me, and I believe it\u2019s blatantly unfair to type him in early part 1 considering he\u2019s brainwashed. Late part 1, shippuden, and current Gaara are all consistent to me. I may or may not make an argument but SX4 is very strange because envy was never directed at a specific person for Gaara. For him it was always about making himself into the image that everyone desired becoming the kazekage. Even in the flashbacks he tells Kankuro and others how much he aspires to be like Naruto and that his whole thing for becoming Kazekage was to be something the people can look up to. Envy wasn\u2019t specific enough to be sexual in my honest opinion. Even in Envidia when they discuss SX4, a lot of it I don\u2019t see in Gaara at all. One specific excerpt from SO4 that I am currently reading as I have the E4 Book opens and it quotes:\n\n\u201cThe social E4 enters relationships feeling indebted, as if the person who is taking them into account is doing them a favor. The favor he is doing is that he is giving him permission to exist, that he is looking at him. That favor comes at a price, and the social E4 immediately feels indebted. Perhaps that is why he sometimes prefers to be alone, so as not to owe so much. His withdrawal is much like that of the E5 character, but while the E5 is relieved and able to regain energy, the social E4 sinks into his emotions and thereby feeds his own self-devaluation. Low self-esteem and the fact of never having felt appreciated and recognized by his mother or by both parents, makes the subject develop the idea that he has no value in the eyes of the world. He feels uninteresting and, often, in his relationship with the other person, especially when the other person is interested in him, he feels very uncomfortable and often loses his lucidity because of the emotions that literally explode inside him and they invade him, which further complicates his relational and communicative capacity. That is why he is surprised when, in spite of everything, the other is really interested in him; almost hard to understand. If I am worth less than you, you will take care of me, you will protect me.\" The social E4 is like a refugee who has crossed the desert without water and will always feel thirsty and lacking. Water is love, also expressed in physical form. As an adult, he keeps alive the need for a hug that he did not have in childhood, or that was taken from him too soon. He is never the first to take the step, he is too afraid of rejection, but indirectly he does everything to receive attention and physical contact from the other. To achieve this, he tends to make himself \"small\" in the eyes of the other. Thus, he sells a functional image of himself that arouses tenderness in order to obtain protection. In these respects you can be confused with the conservative character E6, although the difference between one and the other lies in the strong invasion of emotions and the motivation for the recognition of the group.\u201d\n\nNot only does this excerpt here remind me heavily of Gaara, but it reminds me a lot of characters like Izuku Midoriya and Kaneki Ken as well. While I\u2019m entirely unsure if I\u2019ll make an argument(because Naruto pages are full of useless drama that I have 0 interest in)I would like to at least point out with the book open I see several flaws in the SX4 typing. Sasuke is far too controversial so I won\u2019t even bring up his name, but Deidara is an amazing example of SX4 and fits **** aggression extremely well. Deidara sees the object or person in which he desires and he desires to destroy it whole. His entire motto \u201cart is an explosion!\u201d Alone is extremely exemplary of SX4\u2019s type as an entirety. Gaara desires to shape himself in the desires of the people and being so deeply moved by Naruto and Sasuke and the voices of the people, envy for Gaara seems to represent itself in the social sphere extremely well with how he shapes himself off the desires of the other.\n\nWhen I read excerpts like this form Envidia:\n\n\u201cEnvious passion, in the sexual subtype, takes on the character of a passion to reclaim what is felt to be lost; a claim that is a furious cry against those who have talents, qualities, objects and recognitions, that people who recognize themselves in this character feel that it is their right to have. The existence of sexual E4 is characterized by constant drama, like a lover who despairs of having lost his love and can only hate the one who hurt him so much.\nThis passionate suffering for having been abandoned is what the baby experienced with his mother: the \"witch who left him alone and with nothing. All energies are invested in the search for that lost love.\nThe sexual E4 baby is very likely to be a carrier of a high energy level. They are babies who cry more, are more noticeable, are more lively and annoying than the other envious subtypes.\u201d\n\nI really don\u2019t see it in Gaara.", "create_date": 1671345202000, "unix_timestamp": 1671345202000, "update_date": 1671345202000, "vote_count": 11, "vote_count_down": 0, "is_reported": 0, "is_hidden": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_watching": false, "is_pro_user": false, "images": null, "audios": null, "function_list": [], "type": "post"}]}}}}
