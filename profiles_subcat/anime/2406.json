Because of his pride and confidence in his abilities, he displayed a code of honor as when he tried to defeat Komugi by shaking her resolve. When he gained an understanding of the unfairness of human society, where children starve while pathetic weaklings have everything they need, he wanted to destroy this madness and create a new world where the concept of inequality would be completely forgotten. Furthermore, he came to believe the true purpose of power is to protect the weak who deserve to live, not to torment the defeated. #KokiUchiyama\n#INTJVillains", "follow_count": 4, "id": 5019, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Meruem", "post_count": 45, "source_profile_id": 5408, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/5184b382bcfc453ab2bc17694fbdfc48.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "Chrollo Lucilfer\u00a0(\u30af\u30ed\u30ed\u30a0\u30eb\u30b7\u30eb\u30d5\u30eb), is one of the main antagonists of the anime/manga series\u00a0Hunter \u00d7 Hunter.
