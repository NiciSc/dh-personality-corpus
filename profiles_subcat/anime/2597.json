Itachi is in no way, shape, or form a hero, he's a very morally grey character who is honestly far more ****** up in the head than we think he is. \n\nThe Uchiha Massacre I can kind of understand why he did it. Even though I think the Uchiha were more justified in their rebellion than Konoha was in killing them, I get that Konoha was likely going to defeat the Uchiha in an all out battle and that would result in all of the Uchiha getting killed anyways, so he did this to save Sasuke. The Massacre is grey area. It doesn't make him a good person or terrible person.\n\nBut like, can you really call someone who openly admits that Konoha has flaws, and STILL says that he will \"always be Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf\", a good person? He doesn't care about changing those flaws, like Naruto or even Sasuke, he just rolls with it. He's a very morally neutral person.\n\nAnd then we get into how he treated SASUKE...oh boy.\n\nItachi is easily one of the worst brothers in history. \n\nLike, I don't deny he loves Sasuke. He does, and if nothing else, the massacre proves it, but the way he shows that love is in the most twisted way possible. \n\nWhat kind of reasonable older brother tells a 7 year old child, standing in front of the dead bodies of their parents, to \"live his life in hatred\", to \"kill his best friend for the Mangekyou Sharingan\", and then use a ******* TSUKUYOMI on him and show him KILLING HIS PARENTS for 72 HOURS. That's not loving, that's psychotic. We're talking about a 7 year old. A literal 7 year old. Absolutely no sane, good-hearted person is going to use that on a child, especially their younger brother. For a self proclaimed pacifist, Itachi is quite brutal and harsh. \n\nAnd then, we have how he meets Sasuke in the beginning of the series. Instantly breaks his wrist, gives him another spiel about hatred, and then puts him in a coma that only TSUNADE can break him out of with ANOTHER Tsukuyomi. And I know ppl are going to say \"ooh he had to keep up a character for Kisame!!\" and that's completely bs. Itachi is the same guy who slaughtered the Uchiha Clan to \"test himself\". My man could have easily said something about how he wanted to wait for Sasuke to grow strong and challenge him one day, and that would have fit perfectly with his villain backstory. \n\nMy man instilled the worst possible ideals into Sasuke's impressionable mind. Hatred? Killing your best friend for power? Living in an unsightly manner? Like, what the **** Itachi? I get that he wanted to motivate Sasuke to kill him, but I think Sasuke would have been more than motivated enough to do it since Itachi was quite literally standing in the bodies of their dead parents. And not to mention the fact that he slaughtered virtually their entire clan. If anything, those Tsukuyomi's were more likely to harm Sasuke than help Sasuke. Using such a high-powered Genjutsu on a child has a VERY high chance of turning them completely unstable and ******* them up in the head. Sasuke was very lucky he didn't suffer any long-lasting mental scars from the Tsukuyomis Itachi put on him, because it could have definitely happened.\n\nI think the reason Itachi turned out so morally grey and messed up in the head is because of his own lack of childhood. Got his first kill at 4, became a Chunin before he hit his double digits, was knee-deep in blood as an ANBU by the time he was 13. Itachi was deprived of a good upbringing, and having to kill, lie, and do all of the other **** ninja do (especially in ANBU) from such a young age likely had a massive impact on his mental health. He is not a particularly mentally sound person, let's not kid ourselves. And to be honest, it's largely due to his own life experiences. And while this isn't an excuse, it does provide an explanation.\n\nItachi himself admits he ****** up heavily in his life. Guys, y'all need to stop defending Itachi. I get that his life was really sad, but he's not nearly as morally incorruptible as you think he is.", "create_date": 1672274253000, "unix_timestamp": 1672274253000, "update_date": 1672274779000, "vote_count": 6, "vote_count_down": 0, "is_reported": 0, "is_hidden": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_watching": false, "is_pro_user": false, "images": null, "audios": null, "function_list": [], "type": "post"}, {"username": "blcsalah", "user_pic_path": "https://static1.personality-database.com/user_avatars/1516090/6152be5c-0759-4f73-89d7-0b5ab02c79e1_small.jpeg", "user_personality_type": "XXXX", "is_mod": false, "comment_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "vote_type": 0, "topics_list": [{"id": 2372, "name_readable": "Itachi Uchiha"}], "id": 2040121, "post_id": 2040121, "user_id": 1516090, "title": "my best character of all time", "content": "#naruto #itachi #uchihaitachi #uchiha #akatsuki #villian #anime #INFJ", "create_date": 1672214325000, "unix_timestamp": 1672214325000, "update_date": 1672214393000, "vote_count": 1, "vote_count_down": 0, "is_reported": 0, "is_hidden": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_watching": false, "is_pro_user": false, "images": null, "audios": null, "function_list": [], "type": "post"}, {"username": "Sabrinarock", "user_pic_path": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggx6iJxfBT8U1B4Rd7Mq_3bPYQCAoStRFXlfUba3A=s96-c", "user_personality_type": "ENFP-2w3-279", "is_mod": false, "comment_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "vote_type": 0, "topics_list": [{"id": 2372, "name_readable": "Itachi Uchiha"}], "id": 2038281, "post_id": 2038281, "user_id": 216236, "title": "The episode from the eggs (Sunny Side Battle) is a real inf Se moment ", "content": "And it\u2019s funny as hell.
