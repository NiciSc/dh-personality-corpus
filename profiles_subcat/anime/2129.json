His distance from others initially keeps him level-headed and moralistic, but his heart has been poisoned with sadness and hatred. Having been traumatized from losing everyone he loved at the age of twelve, Kurapika closes his heart to new people and remains introverted as to stay focused on his goal.\n#MiyukiSawashiro\n#INTJHeroes", "follow_count": 20, "id": 1962, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Kurapika", "post_count": 73, "source_profile_id": 2128, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/b996079fde024cfeb4d3572ac23d7ce1.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "Meruem (\u30e1\u30eb\u30a8\u30e0, Meruemu) was the most powerful offspring of the Chimera Ant Queen.

When he gained an understanding of the unfairness of human society, where children starve while pathetic weaklings have everything they need, he wanted to destroy this madness and create a new world where the concept of inequality would be completely forgotten.
