He told Eren Yeager, his best friend, about the book and the information that was inside it. Armin was branded a heretic by the other children, for his unusual interest in the outside world, and was frequently picked on. Too timid to defend himself, Armin would often need to rely on his friends (Eren and Mikasa) to protect him from local bullies. This, coupled with his frail physique, was a source of much shame for Armin, leading him to have poor self-esteem and believe himself to be a burden upon others. Because of this, Armin has always been very eager to prove his worth. As a child, he hoped that one day he would be able to consider himself a true equal to his friends. #MarinaInoue", "follow_count": 47, "id": 755, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Armin Arlert", "post_count": 183, "source_profile_id": 808, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/5203d92b3db843918dabc97f62c3db36.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "Mikasa Ackerman\u00a0is one of the two deuteragonists of the series, along with\u00a0Armin Arlert.\n\nAfter\u00a0her\u00a0parents\u00a0were murdered by\u00a0human traffickers, Mikasa was rescued by\u00a0Eren Yeager\u00a0and lived with him and his parents,\u00a0Grisha\u00a0and\u00a0Carla, before the\u00a0fall of Wall Maria.
