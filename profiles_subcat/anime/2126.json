Finding his father is Gon's motivation in becoming a Hunter.\nGon is an athletic, rustic, and friendly boy who is searching for adventure. His flaws lie in his temper and impulsive nature. Gon sometimes fails to think things through and such actions lead to him suffering. Though possessing talent far beyond the norm for his age, anytime his abilities are challenged, he feels as if he has to prove his antagonist wrong. He continually strives to obtain greater power, often becoming exceptionally stronger in his anger. But Gon's anger also leads to some extremely reckless tendencies. When his emotions are ignited, Gon becomes irrational and completely oblivious to anything else.", "watch_count": 1456, "comment_count": 1127, "vote_count": 2288, "vote_count_enneagram": 1461,
