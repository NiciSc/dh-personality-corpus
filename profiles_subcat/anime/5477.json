He is the leader of the\u00a0Phantom Troupe\u00a0and the main antagonist of the Yorknew City arc.\u00a0\nChrollo Lucilfer is calm, cool, intelligent, and charismatic, as he seems to be a born leader and able to hold the Phantom Troupe together despite the volatile personalities of its members. Unflinching and unshakable, he is also an observer of human nature. Gon's hostility towards the Troupe led Chrollo to reflect upon the nature of his self and his actions. Additionally, when fighting Hisoka, who refused to back down even after seeing the scope of his abilities, he expressed a fascination for the inner workings of human beings. However, by his own claim, he sees no difference between a puppet and a person. #MamoruMiyano", "watch_count": 3079, "comment_count": 1694, "vote_count": 2517, "vote_count_enneagram": 1237,
