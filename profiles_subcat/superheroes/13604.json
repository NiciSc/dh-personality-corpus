A master tactician and a martial arts expert capable of defeating Robin easily, Slade is aided by hordes of robotic minions (even going to the extent of having \"Slade-bots\", or android stand-ins for himself to avoid being exposed to the risk of capture, ala Doctor Doom) and the services of three mutant metahumans; Overload, Cinderblock and Plasmus.
