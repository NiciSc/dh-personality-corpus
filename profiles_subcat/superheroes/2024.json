Unlike Batman and Robin, who were possessed of pasts filled with angst, Barbara was a relatively lighthearted and cheerful crimefighter whose motivation was completely altruistic.\n\nAnyone who pays sufficient attention to the comics, however, knows that she has passed on the mantle of Batgirl and taken up the motif of the computer expert Oracle. Post-Crisis she had already retired from costumed heroics before being shot by the Joker in her home in The Killing Joke, paralyzing her from the waist down. Babs later founded and lead the Birds of Prey and joined the JLA.\n\nIncidentally, Barbara's identity as Oracle makes her far more influential and important in the DC universe than her role as Batgirl
