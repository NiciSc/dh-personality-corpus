He struggles with his self-esteem and self-worth, and it's almost always a problem when he tries to be both spiderman and himself. This leads to black and white (split) thinking, \"if I can't wear the suit, I'm nobody,\" or \"if I can't save *insert person*, then I can't save anybody.\" this also feeds into chronic emptiness since he feels that he is not good enough. It's obvious peter's life is filled with trauma from losing his parents, uncle, and in the MCU; everybody. he tends to have unstable interpersonal relationships; for example, in the comics, he puts MJ on a pedestal and fights with his best friends (like harry) over his over-idealization of MJ. This can be seen with Tony Stark in the MCU spiderman movies, where he idealizes Mr. Stark until Stark does something to stop Peter, then he argues with and \"hates\" Stark (as seen in homecoming). Peter Parker is no stranger to romance, and in the comics, as on-again-of-again relationships that never seem to stick, which, soon will be shown in the MCU. Peter also seems to do whatever he can to avoid abandonment, even if that means trying to help every villain out in No Way Home, saying he can help everyone, have his cake and eat it too. he attaches himself to his friends and love interests, be spiderman and have his girlfriend, best friend, and family safe too. He does not want to abandon that stability, even when it wasn't even stable to begin with. His fear of losing others while being a superhero becomes problematic for him. \n\nThe thing that's the most obvious with Peter is that he engages in self-harm and impulsivity, actively going against stark, constantly putting him in situations where he could be injured or killed with no thought process at all (though, if you look through my profile, you could see that I said the same thing about Steve Harrington, except Steve Harrington's impulsivity comes from the theory that he actually has ADHD, not BPD. It's quite easy to tell Peter's BPD apart from Steve's ADHD because Steve doesn't think things through before acting; he's not doing things for self-destructive reasons compared to Peter, also because Steve is a Se Dom.) Peter almost always finds himself in trouble after acting out of impulse and never knows when to stop himself, which lands him in a situation he is in no way home. Peter can be emotional; in other iterations, he can be quite explosive. There have been times when peter was depressed and even anxious. \n\nRegardless, peter doesn't really fit the classical diagnostic criteria for BPD, yet struggles with four or more cluster B traits. His fear of abandonment might not be as outward compared to someone like Harley Quinn, his impulsivity and self-sabotage might not be out there compared to someone like Bojack Horseman, and his wavering self-identity might not be dramatized like Anakin Skywalker. or engage in the same self-harm techniques compared to Holland's partner's character Rue Bennett; But it's still there. It's safe to say Peter struggles with 'quiet' BPD. to quote the person who originally came up with this theory: \n\n\"Peter has had many environmental factors that lead him to develop these aspects of his personality, which is what BPD is. Between severe trauma and loss at such a young age and a severe split in his personal identity at such a formative age, Peter fits the criteria for diagnosing BPD.\"", "create_date": 1671222094000, "unix_timestamp": 1671222094000, "update_date": 1671222094000, "vote_count": 6, "vote_count_down": 0, "is_reported": 1, "is_hidden": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_watching": false, "is_pro_user": false, "images": null, "audios": null, "function_list": [], "type": "post"}, {"username": "rheaa", "user_pic_path": "https://static1.personality-database.com/user_avatars/654487/dcf29fed-8799-48e7-acf8-48d6df629de4_small.jpeg", "user_personality_type": "ESFJ-2w3-216", "is_mod": false, "comment_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "vote_type": 0, "topics_list": [{"id": 2364, "name_readable": "Peter Parker \"Spider-Man\""}], "id": 1892391, "post_id": 1892391, "user_id": 654487, "title": "", "content": "lorddd LORDDDD\n\n(even tho our typologies are. very different)", "create_date": 1670485283000, "unix_timestamp": 1670485283000, "update_date": 1670485283000, "vote_count": 4, "vote_count_down": 0, "is_reported": 0, "is_hidden": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_watching": false, "is_pro_user": false, "images": null, "audios": null, "function_list": [], "type": "post"}, {"username": "user729101", "user_pic_path": "https://static1.personality-database.com/user_avatars/639584/a6c50a6c-a8b5-41dd-b43e-d036687cfc33.jpeg", "user_personality_type": "XXXX", "is_mod": false, "comment_count": 1, "reply_count": 1, "vote_type": 0, "topics_list": [{"id": 2364, "name_readable": "Peter Parker \"Spider-Man\""}], "id": 1697519, "post_id": 1697519, "user_id": 639584, "title": "", "content": "It's so obvious that he's so7", "create_date": 1666964475000, "unix_timestamp": 1666964475000, "update_date": 1666964475000, "vote_count": 8, "vote_count_down": 0, "is_reported": 1, "is_hidden": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_watching": false, "is_pro_user": false, "images": null, "audios": null, "function_list": [], "type": "post"}]}}}}
