Dr. Michael Morbius is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Roy Thomas and originally designed by penciler Gil Kane, the character first appeared as an antagonist in The Amazing Spider-Man #101 (Oct. 1971).\n\nDespite his initial status as one of Spider-Man's horror-based rogues, he went on to become a brooding and gritty, albeit heroic and tragically flawed antihero in his own series and other titles. His true identity was former award-winning biochemist named Michael Morbius imbued with pseudo-vampiric superhuman abilities and physical traits stemming from a failed biochemical experiment which was intended to cure his rare blood disorder, as opposed to supernatural means. The rest of his appearances feature his struggles with his non-human vampiric persona, his insatiable lust for human blood and his subsequent efforts to cure his horrific condition.", "follow_count": 0, "id": 70238, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Michael Morbius \"Morbius\"", "post_count": 1, "source_profile_id": 86818, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/f7961514a218449cb896312abe15eed3.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "Magneto  is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men.
