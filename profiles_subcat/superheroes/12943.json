By 2018, Luis and his colleagues dropped their criminal careers and started a company called X-Con Security Consultants, allowing them to have a job despite their criminal records. During that time, Luis assisted Ant-Man and the Wasp into defending Hank Pym's mobile laboratory from Ghost. Luis seems to be loyal towards all his friends which includes Dave, Kurt Goreshter and Scott Lang. He also likes to support his friends, like when he supported Scott Lang to rob into Hank Pym's house, even feeling sorry for him when he failed. He is also shown to be a disobedient man such as when he was told not to whistle in Pym Technologies Headquarters, but he whistled as if nobody told him not to do it. Despite his criminal background, he possesses a good moral compass by taking the time to save the life of a security guard he incapacitated when Pym Technologies was about to explode.", "watch_count":
