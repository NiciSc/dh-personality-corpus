Prior to joining the Teen Titans, Jinx was a top student of the H.I.V.E. Academy and the leader of the H.I.V.E. Five. She is also the girlfriend of Kid Flash. Jinx had proven herself to be a very ambitious go-getter with a somewhat of a mean streak. Because of her goals to rise among the ranks of villains, she tries her best to be an effective H.I.V.E. member under both its regimes. Far more mature, focused, and controlled than her male teammates, Jinx has proven to be a largely capable and determined (if subconsciously insecure) leader. She also idolized Madame Rouge of the Brotherhood of Evil, before Kid Flash stepped in to change her mind. Jinx appears to be quiet, mean, mysterious, often speaking in whispers, and sometimes depicted as rather crazy because of the evil, crooked grin she usually wore when battling.", "watch_count": 212,
