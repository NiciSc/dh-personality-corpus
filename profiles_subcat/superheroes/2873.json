He was raised by the League of Assassins (and has been implied to be the subject of genetic experimentation); as such, he's a ferocious warrior and quite skilled at martial arts in spite of how young he is. Talia only revealed his existence to Batman in another bid to bring Bruce to her side.\n\nDamian is a violent, often bratty child, but he's genuinely proud to be Batman's son and wishes to play his part in his father's war against crime, although his upbringing in the League often puts him at odds with Batman's methods. His relationship with the Robins and particularly Tim is heavily conflicted, and he has more than a few entitlement issues. After his father's death, he becomes the new Robin when Dick becomes Batman full-time. Once Bruce returns and takes up the mantle of Batman once again, Damian continues to work with Dick.", "watch_count": 525, "comment_count": 77, "vote_count": 284, "vote_count_enneagram": 147,
