While he had his fans, the revamped Jason ultimately proved unpopular with readers, primarily due to the fact that he simply wasn't Dick Grayson, with added fuel resulting from an event that left it ambiguous about whether or not he had killed someone. He was voted to death.\n\nThen Infinite Crisis happened.\n\nSuperboy-Prime punching the walls of reality caused \"ripples\" to affect the time-stream across the larger DCU. Jason Todd awakened in his grave and clawed himself out a changed man. Recovered by Talia al Ghul and given extensive training in assassination and gunplay, Jason adopted the name Red Hood, an alias that once belonged to his killer and went on a one-man crusade against crime in Gotham City. During this, he also challenged the Dark Knight himself, whose code he sees as foolish and useless, while also seeking answers for why his former mentor never avenged him.", "watch_count": 935,
