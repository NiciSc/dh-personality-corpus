(First Class), (10 March 1960\u20132 May 1998), also known as Moony, was a half-blood wizard and the only son of Lyall and Hope Lupin (n\u00e9e Howell). He was attacked by werewolf Fenrir Greyback when he was a child, a result of Greyback's revenge against Lyall, leaving Remus afflicted with lycanthropy for life. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1971 to 1978 and was sorted into Gryffindor House. During his school years he was one of the Marauders, best friends with Sirius Black, James Potter, and Peter Pettigrew. Remus was compassionate, intelligent, tolerant, levelheaded, peaceful, selfless, brave, kind, and good-natured. Despite having suffered a great deal of prejudice in his life due to his lycanthropy, he managed to retain an ability to see the good in almost everybody and was extremely forgiving. Remus also had an excellent sense of humour. However, unlike his friends, he never partook in bullying.", "watch_count": 3070, "comment_count": 186, "vote_count": 1030, "vote_count_enneagram": 461, "vote_count_mbti": 1030, "total_vote_counts":
