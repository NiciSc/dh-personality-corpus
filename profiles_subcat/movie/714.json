Neville's parents were well-respected Aurors and members of the original Order of the Phoenix until they were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and three other Death Eaters with the Cruciatus Curse when he was about sixteen months old. When he was younger, Neville was clumsy, forgetful, shy, and many considered him ill-suited for Gryffindor house because he seemed timid. However, Neville proved that the Sorting Hat had seen the bravery beneath his insecurity, as he stood up to his only friends as a first-year. Neville's problem seems to have been poor self-esteem, as he referred to himself as a \"nobody\" and \"almost a Squib\". This was likely caused by his grandmother's belief that he was not living up to his parents' accomplishments, and browbeating from fellow students and people like Professor Snape.\n\n#MatthewLewis\n#ISFJHeroes", "watch_count": 702, "comment_count": 141, "vote_count": 628, "vote_count_enneagram": 267, "vote_count_mbti": 628, "total_vote_counts": 1206, "personality_type":

In turn, this caused the Potter family to go into hiding. Voldemort made his first vain attempt to circumvent the prophecy when Harry was a year and three months old. During this attempt, he murdered Harry's parents as they tried to protect him, but this unsuccessful attempt to kill Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall.

He was a half-blood, Muggle-supporting wizard considered to have been the greatest wizard of modern times, perhaps of all time. The son of Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, and the elder brother of Aberforth and Ariana. His father died in Azkaban when Dumbledore was young, while his mother and sister were later accidentally killed. His early losses greatly affected him early on, even at his death, but, in turn, made him a better person. #RichardHarris & #MichaelGambon", "follow_count": 2, "id": 663, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Albus Dumbledore", "post_count": 11, "source_profile_id": 712, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/acb1c880bee241bfa914093ee1016ef3.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "#MatthewLewis as Neville Longbottom\n#ISFJHeroes", "follow_count": 2, "id": 665, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Neville Longbottom", "post_count": 8, "source_profile_id": 714, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/ba81992e02594c25bbf18baca128e536.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "#DavidThewlis", "follow_count": 4, "id": 711, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Remus Lupin", "post_count": 8, "source_profile_id": 761, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/b6d1828298a04dfdbee2a0575ca93bf1.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "", "follow_count": 4, "id": 2686, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Rubeus Hagrid", "post_count": 6, "source_profile_id": 2935, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/a4a350352d3949acbf16f8b55e1460ad.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}, {"description": "#TobyJones", "follow_count": 2, "id": 666, "is_following": false, "is_join_pending": false, "is_banned": false, "is_moderated": false, "name_readable": "Dobby", "post_count": 4, "source_profile_id": 715, "source_type": "profile", "image": {"picURL": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/acdfc25dd71d4d4d923fd944773ac55e.png"}, "join_to_post": false, "can_pin": false}], "subcategory": "Harry Potter / Wizarding World Films", "topic_image_url": "https://static1.personality-database.com/profile_images/ba81992e02594c25bbf18baca128e536.png", "source_location": {"cid": 3, "pid": 2, "sub_cat_id": 87}, "can_post_image": false, "can_post_audio": false, "posts": {"posts": [{"username": "Yin Yang", "user_pic_path": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AItbvmk4YHxz1uGybWYVZ3FGfglhN91yhOEB4ZURzOZF=s96-c", "user_personality_type": "XXXX", "is_mod": false, "comment_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "vote_type": 0, "topics_list": [{"id": 665, "name_readable": "Neville Longbottom"}], "id": 2093967, "post_id": 2093967, "user_id": 61031, "title": "", "content": "Such a clear Isfj.
